# React-Expense-Tracker

### Introduction.

Capstone projects are solo projects at the end of the each of the Microverse Main Technical Curriculum sections. Building this project is very important for you because:

* It's a real-world-like project, built with business specifications that will look really nice in your portfolio; and
* You will get feedback about the achievement of technical and soft skills gained during this section of the program.
